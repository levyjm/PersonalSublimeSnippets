# PersonalSublimeSnippets

This is a Sublime Text plugin that allows users to add their own code snippets to a json file, that they can then search, retrieve, and add to their own code for quick reference.


### How it works
A user will activate CodeSnippets from Sublime Text, he or she will then select to either **Add Snippet** or **Search Snippets**. The user will then define the language he or she wants to work with. if the user selected **Add**, the plugin will ask for a name for the snippet (for easy reference) and then ask for the snippet. If the user selected **Search**, it will display all snippets he or she has included for that particular language.


### Why
Why not? I stumbled upon the Sublime Text API the other day and was excited to see that it is Pythonic. Although I mostly use VSCode (which already has a "snippets" feature), I thought it would be fun and relatively painless to create a Sublime Text plugin, espescially since Python is a fun language to code.
